                For many people, bread is a pantry staple. They almost always have it on hand, using it in any meal throughout the day. Whether you toast it, make sandwiches or transform it in different recipes, you may find yourself asking, “Is bread healthy?” With so many bread products and types out there, it’s best not to answer that question with a sweeping “yes.” But there are health benefits to different kinds of bread.

Overall, the products you choose determine if bread is good for you. You want products made with quality ingredients from a trusted manufacturer. How you eat bread products will also affect the impact on your health. As with all things, you should enjoy bread in moderation to avoid any drawbacks. Some suggest limiting yourself to one serving of bread per meal or per day, depending on what else you eat and the type of bread product you’re enjoying. Check the bread nutrition facts and follow serving suggestions or enjoy less at a time, based on your diet.
